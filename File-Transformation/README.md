# Python-File-Transformation: Pandas

## Background

My business partners share metrics forecast as an unstructured Excel file, which makes it difficult to further scale up data processing & reporting.

## Methods and Functions used
I use Python Pandas to transform the input file from business partners into a structured table to further load it into online DataBase and incorporate it into automated reporting pipeline.

## How to navigate
1. Metrics_Forecast.xlsx is the forecast file that I receive from my business partners.
2. File_transformation_Github.ipynb file contains Python script
