# Python-Sales-Analysis: Pandas | Plotly

## Background

In this project I analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

## Questions Addressed
* What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
* What city sold the most product?
* What products are most often sold together?
* What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?

## Methods and Functions used
* Reading all files from single folder
* Treating NaN values
* Removing rows based on a condition
* Changing column types (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
* Adding columns
* Using the .apply() method
* Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
* Plotting graphs to visualize results
* Formatting graphs
